=Todo App
==This is my third rails app

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails).

I built a Todo application following the Todo app by mackenziechild. We have the ability to create multiple Todo lists and multiple Todo items for each list, and also the ability to mark an item as complete.
